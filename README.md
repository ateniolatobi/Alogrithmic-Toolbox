# ALGORITHMIC TOOLBOX

## Description

The repository contains my solutions to the various algorithmic problems of the Algorithmic Toolbox course which is the first course of the Data Structures and Algorithms specialization offered by the University of California San Diego and the National Research University Higher School of Economics through Coursera

The questions for each week are stored in pdf files which are in their respective week folders. The solutions to the problems are implemented using primarily Cpp and in some cases python.
